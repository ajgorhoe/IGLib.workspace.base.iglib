# New project from Foidl's Particle Swarm Code

Upgrade to .NET 8 could not be done easily for the project.

Therefore, a new Windows Forms project was created from scratch (**[ParticleSwarmFoidlNew.csproj](./src/ParticleSwarmFoidlNew/ParticleSwarmFoidlNew.csproj)**) and the old code was added into it.

The directory **[FilesFromProjectCreation/](./src/ParticleSwarmFoidlNew/FilesFromProjectCreation/)** contains the original files from the time project was created. These were used to make thee minimal WinForms project dual-target both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8.


## Old Files Kept

The **[src/Backup_ParticleSwarmFoidl_Original/](./src/Backup_ParticleSwarmFoidl_Original/)** directory contains files form the original project downloaded from CodeProject (see the links).

Directory **[src/ParticleSwarmFoidl/](./src/ParticleSwarmFoidl/)** contains the old project **[00ParticleSwarmFoidl.csproj](./src/ParticleSwarmFoidl/00ParticleSwarmFoidl.csproj)** with code that was a slightly corrected original project, just in the way that project begun to work (the original project code downloaded long time ago from CodeProject did not work).

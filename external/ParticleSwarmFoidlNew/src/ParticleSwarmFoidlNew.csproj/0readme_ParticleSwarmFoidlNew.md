# New project from Foidl's Particle Swarm Code

Upgrade to .NET 8 couuls not be done easily for the project.

Therefore, a new Windows Forms project was created from scratch and the old code was put into it.

The directory **FilesFromProjectCreation** contains the original files from the time project was created. These were used to make thee minimal WinForms project dual-target both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8.


Solution folder Speech:

This folder contains projects that depend on the Microsoft COM speech
library. 

Unload the ReporterMsg_Speech project in this solution folder unless you 
actually want to use it. In this way you will get rid of unpleasant warning 
messages while all dependent projects will still build. Reload the project
only when you are modifying something within it, and unload it after
modifications are done and rebuild is performed.


This project contains an extended neural network library, which MAY contain:
  - additional ANN approximators based on external libraries
  - 2D and 3D graphical dependencies

Currently, such features are mainly included in higher level libraries that are NOT part
of the basic distribution of IGLib (although they might be considered a part of IGLib
and the same license conditions may applied). 

It will be considered whether this library is really needed, or code suitable for this
library will continue to reside in higher level libraries within the "base/shelldev/"
directory.
